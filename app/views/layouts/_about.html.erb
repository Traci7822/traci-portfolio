          <p>As an avid problem-solver through life, I am on a never ending quest to learn.
            This is what drove me to enroll in The Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program and become a developer.
            With a varied background as a professional chef, artist and experience in the field of Public Health I love approaching problems with a wide encompassing perspective.
            If you are looking for a motivated team-player with creative development skills, I would love to speak with you.
